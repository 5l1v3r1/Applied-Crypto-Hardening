== Tools

This section lists tools for checking the security settings.

=== SSL & TLS

Server checks via the web

https://ssllabs.com[ssllabs.com] offers a great way to check your webserver for
misconfigurations. See https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/. Furthermore,
_ssllabs.com_ has a good best practices tutorial, which focuses on avoiding the
most common mistakes in SSL.

SSL Server certificate installation issues https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html

Check SPDY protocol support and basic TLS setup http://spdycheck.org/

XMPP/Jabber Server check (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Server) https://xmpp.net/

Luxsci SMTP TLS Checker https://luxsci.com/extranet/tlschecker.html

DNSsec and DANE support of your domain and e-mail server? https://dane.sys4.de

http://checktls.com is a tool for testing arbitrary TLS services.

http://tls.secg.org is a tool for testing interoperability of HTTPS
implementations for ECC cipher suites.

http://www.whynopadlock.com/ Testing for mixed SSL parts loaded via http that
can totally lever your HTTPS.

=== Browser Checks

Check your browser’s SSL capabilities: https://cc.dcsec.uni-hannover.de/ and https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html.

Check Browsers SSL/TLS support and vulnerability to attacks:
https://www.howsmyssl.com

=== Command Line Tools

https://sourceforge.net/projects/sslscan connects to a given SSL service and
shows the cipher suites that are offered.

http://www.bolet.org/TestSSLServer/ tests for BEAST and CRIME vulnerabilities.

https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh checks a server’s service on any port for
the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some cryptographic flaws
(CRIME, BREACH, CCS, Heartbleed).

https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze Fast and full-featured SSL scanner.

https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan Fast TLS scanner (ciphers, order,
protocols, key size and more)

http://nmap.org/ nmap security scanner

http://www.openssl.net OpenSSL s_client

Monitoring TLS services with Zabbix (sorry, German) https://blog.sys4.de/zertifikate-uberwachen-mit-zabbix-de.html

=== Key length

http://www.keylength.com comprehensive online resource for comparison of key
lengths according to common recommendations and standards in cryptography.

=== Random Number Generators

http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/[ENT] is a pseudo random number generator
sequence tester.

http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php[Dieharder] a random number
generator testing tool.

http://www.cacert.at/random/[CAcert Random] another random number generator
testing service.
